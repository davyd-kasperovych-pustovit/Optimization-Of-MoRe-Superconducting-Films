Superconducting materials form the foundation of many emerging quantum devices. In the Finkelstein Lab, we are developing graphene-based quantum devices that exploit these superconducting phenomena to study coherent electron transport and novel correlated states. To enable these measurements, we employ molybdenum–rhenium (MoRe), a superconducting alloy well suited for integration with two-dimensional materials.

This project focuses on optimizing the fabrication of MoRe thin films using DC magnetron sputtering. The student will systematically vary deposition parameters such as argon pressure, discharge power, and working distance to tune the films’ superconducting properties. Films will be deposited on SiO₂/Si substrates with thicknesses in the few-nanometer range. Their electrical properties will be characterized by measuring resistivity as a function of temperature down to 2 K using an automated cryocooler setup. The best-performing films—those with the highest critical temperature and current—will be used to establish reproducible sputtering conditions for integrating MoRe with graphene–hBN heterostructures.

Future directions include combining the optimized MoRe films with the graphene–hBN heterostructures to create superconducting devices. This includes superconducting electronics such as single-photon detectors, resonators, and other quantum circuits, with applications spanning quantum sensing, computation, and fundamental studies of two-dimensional superconductivity.
